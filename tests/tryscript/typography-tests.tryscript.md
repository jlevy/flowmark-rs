# Typography Tests

Smart quotes, ellipses, and their interaction with code blocks and escapes.

## T1: Smart quotes only

```console
$ flowmark --smartquotes fixtures/content/typography.md
# Typography Tests

He said “hello” to her.

She replied ‘goodbye’ quietly.

It’s a beautiful day, and they don’t know it won’t last.

“Nested 'single quotes’ inside double quotes” are tricky.

The sentence trails off... and then continues.

“The word trailed off...” she said quietly.

This has “bold *emphasis* inside quotes” for testing.

## Quotes in Headings

### “Quoted Heading”

Apostrophes: the cat’s meow, the '90s, rock ‘n’ roll.
```

## T2: Ellipses only

```console
$ flowmark --ellipses fixtures/content/typography.md
# Typography Tests

He said "hello" to her.

She replied 'goodbye' quietly.

It's a beautiful day, and they don't know it won't last.

"Nested 'single quotes' inside double quotes" are tricky.

The sentence trails off … and then continues.

"The word trailed off …" she said quietly.

## Quotes in Headings

### "Quoted Heading"

```

## T3: Smart quotes + ellipses combined

```console
$ flowmark --smartquotes --ellipses fixtures/content/typography.md
# Typography Tests

He said “hello” to her.

She replied ‘goodbye’ quietly.

It’s a beautiful day, and they don’t know it won’t last.

```

## T4: Smart quotes NOT converted in code blocks

Verify code block content preserved and only text outside code blocks gets converted.

```console
$ flowmark --smartquotes fixtures/content/code-blocks.md | tail -1
Text after code blocks with “quotes” and ... ellipses.
```

## T5: Ellipses NOT converted in code blocks

```console
$ flowmark --ellipses fixtures/content/code-blocks.md | tail -1
Text after code blocks with "quotes" and … ellipses.
```

## T6: Smart quotes with escapes

```console
$ flowmark --smartquotes fixtures/content/escapes.md
# Escape Tests

Backslash escapes: \* not bold \* and \# not a heading.

Escaped brackets: \[not a link\] and \- not a list.

A “quoted” word with escapes: “literal quotes”.

Regular text after escapes.
```

## T7: Apostrophes and contractions (inline)

```console
$ printf "It's a test and they don't know.\n" | flowmark --smartquotes -
It’s a test and they don’t know.
```

## T8: Typography edge cases (inline)

```console
$ printf 'He said "hello." And then... nothing.\n' | flowmark --smartquotes --ellipses -
He said “hello.” And then … nothing.
```
